1.The kernel hardwares of computer :
    CPU, Memory, Hard disc, Graphic card
      These hardwares transmit datas through level signals(电平信号), comprised of high(>2.4V)and low(<0.4V) level signals, which ensures 
    the accuracy of transmission against circuit hardwares'defects.
      And we use "1" to indicate high level, and "0" to indicate low level, that way we have "Binary Systems(二进制)".
